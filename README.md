# Tomb Raider I: Community Edition

This is an open source implementation of the classic Tomb Raider I game. It was
made by reverse engineering the TombATI / GLRage variant of the original game
and replacing proprietary audio/video libraries with open source variants.

See the [Tomb Raider Forums
topic](https://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?p=8286101).

This project was inspired by Arsunt's
[TR2Main](https://github.com/Arsunt/TR2Main/) project and the legacy name,
"Tomb1Main", reflects that.

## Installing

1. Download the latest Tomb1Main release from the GitHub releases.  
   https://github.com/rr-/Tomb1Main/releases

2. Unpack the contents to your game directory.  
   Make sure you choose to overwrite existing directories and files
   (`Tomb1Main_config.json5` can remain).

3. (**Steam users / music**) The Steam version of the game does not ship with the
   music assets due to the publishers' negligence. If you have previously
   installed TombATI, you don't need to do anything. Otherwise you can download
   the music files from the link below.  
   https://mega.nz/file/f9llhQAY#y0RqaMhR4ghtQ-1IFAGbHep_FCmkV8Q66bzdMWVqtuY  
   **These assets are not a part of this project.** The legality of these is
   disputable. The most legal way to get the music on PC is to rip the assets
   yourself from a physical PlayStation disk. TombATI ships with this music by
   default, which this project chooses not to do.

4. Launch `Tomb1Main.exe`.

### Unfinished Business

1. (**Steam users / Unfinished Business**) The Unfinished Business expansion
   pack is freeware, however, the Steam version of the game does not ship with
   it and you'll need to install it separately. If you have previously
   installed TombATI, you don't need to do anything. Otherwise you can download
   the expansion pack from the link below.  
   https://mega.nz/file/i8s0BAaD#wy3xyhuaHnco7aJKiKUV3zO6vCe86lLa3W7hWu249-M

2. Launch the game with `-gold` command line switch. A more detailed instruction:

    1. Create a shortcut to `Tomb1Main.exe`.

    2. Select the newly created shortcut, go to File Properties.

    3. At the end of the "target" field, append `-gold` so it looks something like
        this:  
        `(...)\Tomb1Main.exe -gold`

    4. Launch the shortcut.

If you install everything correctly, your game directory should look more or
less like this (click to expand):

## Q&A

1. **Is the game fully playable from beginning to the end?**

    Yes. If you encounter a bug, please file a ticket.

2. **Can we get HD textures? Reflections? Other graphical updates?**

    Eventually, probably yes. Please see the road map to have a general idea
    what is currently being worked on.

3. **Can we get braid in every level? Skyboxes? Flyby cameras? New animations? etc.**

    Not sure at this moment; this requires meddling with the original game
    level files. It's one thing fixing a faulty trigger bit in The Great
    Pyramid for the final secret, and another to insert a completely new
    animation, a textured mesh or a sound file and pretend it's always been a
    part of the original game. So far we haven't found a good way that'll keep
    the code maintainable.

4. **Can I play this on Mac, Linux, Android...?**

    No promises here, but the game is now playable with wine (including sound
    and music) and there is planned work towards reducing the amount of
    Windows-only code.

## Level kills and pickup notes
The game can show the total number of pickups and kills in a level by checking
the compass in the inventory or at the end of level stats screen. Due to some
of the levels' design, some of these kills and pickups are not obtainable.
See the table below for the discrepancies. Unreachable items are in parentheses.
